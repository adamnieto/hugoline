Hugline is a elegant portfolio theme for Hugo. The theme was was created using [Preline UI](https://preline.co/index.html). Preline UI is a open source UI framework that was built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a static site generator written in the Golang programming language.

Special thanks to [dirkolbrich/hugo-tailwindcss-starter-theme](https://github.com/dirkolbrich/hugo-tailwindcss-starter-theme) which helped to kickstart the theme.
